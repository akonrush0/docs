Within the "**Email reports**" section of your website settings you can decide to enable weekly (every Monday) and/or monthly (every 1st day of the month) reports to be sent directly through email. 

All the stats are embedded directly into the email and there's no need to go to the Plausible Analytics website to view them. There are no attachments, no PDFs and no links to click on in the email reports either.

## Set email reports to be sent to multiple recipients

Email reports can be set to be sent to multiple recipients. Enable the weekly and/or monthly report, add an individual recipient into the "**Report recipients**" field and click on the "**Add recipient**" button. 

You can set the email reports to be sent to as many people as you want. You can remove individual report recipients or completely stop the scheduled email reports at any time.
